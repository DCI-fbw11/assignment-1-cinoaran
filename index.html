            <strong>A new report shows</strong><br/>
            In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic
            decline.
            That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit
            organization that closely monitors penguins and other <span class="red">Antarctic seabirds</span>, in
            collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in
            New York.
            Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660
            sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health
            of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and
            gentoo. Like endangered <a href="#">polar bears</a>, penguins have come to represent
            vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="#">climate change</a>.
            The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by
            a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years.
            There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
            severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to
            changing circumstances.
